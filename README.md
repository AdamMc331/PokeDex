# PokeDex

![Android Build](https://github.com/AdamMc331/PokeDex/workflows/Android%20Build/badge.svg)

A sample pokedex application that serves as a playground for me to try out testing and other best practices. 

This should be a good example of MVVM architecture, along with how to use reactive flows. There will be full unit and UI test support as well. 

## Network Mocking

* This [blog post](https://tech.okcupid.com/ui-tests-with-mockwebserver/) on MockWebServer.

## Unit Testing

If you landed here to learn about unit testing, check out the following resources:
* This [blog post](https://androidessence.com/unit-testing-async-code) to on overriding Schedulers/Dispatchers.
* This [pull request](https://github.com/AdamMc331/PokeDex/pull/24) which demonstrates adding the robot pattern for unit tests.

## Coroutines

Want to see code examples of coroutines, and compare them to RxJava? You could analyze [this pull request](https://github.com/AdamMc331/PokeDex/pull/18).

## Static Analysis

In October 2019 I spoke at the NY Android Developers meetup and presented on static analysis tools. I used this repo as a sample project. You can find the slides [here](nyandroid_staticanalysis_pres/static_analysis.pdf).
